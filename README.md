# the disconnected ensemble

> slides

Built with this sort of Frankenstein system that uses Reveal.js *with* gulp instead of Grunt, because I'm stubborn like that.

## To build slides

Clone repository. Then run

```bash
npm install
```

Then

```bash
npm run build
```

Open `dist/index.html`.

## Or to access them online

Easier, right?
